const aboutJonArbuckle = `Hi there everyone! My name is Jon Arbuckle. I am 30 years old and I am a
cartoonist that lives in Muncie, IN.\n  I am the proud owner of a cat named Garfield and
a dog named Odie. Garfield is fat, lazy and loves to eat, while Odie is a dog
without a brain. Although my pets drive me crazy, I can't imagine life without them.
I spend about half my time going to the grocery store to buy enough food to
feed Garfield. I have to make sure to buy all of Garfirled's favorite foods, or else
he'll get grumpy. This includes milk, cheese, bread, ham, chicken wings, potato chips,
pasta with marinara sauce, frozen pizzas, and lots and lots of lasagna. When I come home,
Garfield usually attacks me and tries to eat everything in the grocery bag before I even have time to
put it in the refrigerator. One time he ate everything that I bought in 30 seconds,
and I had to go back to the store to buy more food. I wasn't too happy about that.
